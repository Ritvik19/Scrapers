       "      <td>A normal company is owned by shareholders. If a company has 10 shares, those shares are divided between people, and they can sell their share to other people. The shareholders elect a CEO and approve major decisions at stockholder meetings, often held once a year. The CEO runs the basics of the company, makes major appointments and so on, determines wages, etc. The excess profits the company makes which are not put into maintainence or expansion, are then divided by the shareholders. So if after everyone is paid, the bills are paid, and after the new factory has been built and paid for, the company has an extra 10 million dollars lying around, each share receives 1 million dollars. (In reality, it's more likely a company has thousands of shares.). Usually things like building the new factory have to be approved by shareholders, as it's \"Their\" excess money you are tapping into.\\n\\nOne person could own 6 of the 10 shares. This is called being a \"Majority shareholder\", it means they make all the decisions and the only reason for others to own shares is to get a slice of the profits after each year.\\n\\nIn a worker cooperative there are no shareholders of  this kind. Instead, working at the company (Sometimes, working there for a length of time like 3 years) gets you one share, and you cannot sell it. You can then elect the CEO, who will set wages, make major appointments, and so on. You can also receive your share of the companies profits at the end of each year. (Most cooperatives will differentiate here however, and say that while everyone gets one vote, some jobs earn more share of the profit than others. Mondragon uses 3 shares for unskilled labour, 5 for skilled labour, 7 for experts and managers.).\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe workers, like shareholders, can decide to call an emergency meeting to fire the CEO if they get up to shenanigans. They can propose things at the annual meetings like \"Wages must be set to X\" and vote on them.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nImagine everything at the company was the same, but the workers and shareholders are the same people. Since they aren't doing the same job at the same time, nothing would actually change about your job and how you do it, beyond the fact that the people who own your company would be you and your co-workers. 9-5 your job remains the same and with the same stuff going on. It's just that once a year you go to the shareholder meeting and make decisions.\\n\\nSo basically, a workers cooperative are where Workers are like Batman. But instead of secretly being Batman, occasionally they become Bruce Wayne for a day. You wouldn't know it unless you happened to observe them changing out of their overalls into suits and ties to go to the stockholder meeting, though you might suspect something is amiss by the way their bosses seem not to be assholes to them, their work seems comfortable and well paid, and their CEO pops in to say hi and ask if they need anything.\\n\\nThis has a wide range of effects which are bit more complicated.</td>\n",
       "      <td>Thanks, that makes a lot of sense! For whatever reason I assumed that there would be more major changes.</td>\n",
       "      <td>There was this coop supermarket near me growing up, but it seemed to me other than slightly high wages than the minimum according to friends, it was just the same as any other store. apple also pay slightly more than minimum but they aren't a co-op.</td>\n",
       "      <td>There might be, depending on how this fundamental difference manifests itself. But day to day, it's pretty much the same, except suddenly your bosses and their bosses are chosen by your peers instead of people only interested in how much money the company makes. A co-op could decide to act the same way and be like; \"We're a co-op for people who don't care about the job being miserable, because it's all about the money money money\", and that's fine. Most wouldn't though.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAppointing a CEO who promises to freeze wages, downsize, and deliver more profit to shareholders is pretty common. Among workers that'd be like; \"I'll pay you all less so I can pay you all the same money I just took from you on a different day\" and they'd be like...\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n\"...No? We prefer the guy who wants to do a major investment into the dining hall, because that place is shit.\", or \"Actually we prefer the guy who convinced us to give up 2000 this year from the shareholder bonus each so he can invest it in improving our steel mill to keep it competitive, thus securing our jobs for another 10 years.\". (Shareholders prefering quick pay outs to investment is one major problem a lot of industries face, and is a major reason for outsourcing. I coulllldd give up some of my money to invest in your car plant in michigan and pay for repairs... or I could not do that, and instead use that money to buy shares in the chinese one instead.\".\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nShareholders can be like \"Well my investment is moving to china so I don't care.\".Workers are not likely to be like \"Rather than fix this one, why don't we all literally physically move to China and work there?\"\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nVulture capitalists are people who buy shares from people like the Michigan shareholder and say \"Sell us your shares to us so you can buy chinese ones. We want to fire everybody, sell the building, sell the machines for scrap, and so on.\".  \\n\\n\\nThis is an example of how worker coops can actually be more competitive than capitalism, by keeping the pressure on eachother to invest in their companies rather than just being like \"Well fuck it i'll buy shares in the other one.\".</td>\n",
       "      <td>The Coop supermarket in the UK is better than average... but not as good as you'd expect, because most of their effort is spent on voting to do things like fair trade, avoid investing in landmines and so on. That's one explanation. If you framed it purely on a local scale, the co-op is just a better than normal employer, but nothing revolutionary. But that'd be ignoring that all their goods pay third world farmers well, they don't use sweat shops, they don't invest in unethical businesses, are aiming for total renewability, and so on. That's where a lot of their focus is on their meetings and where a lot of the money goes. It could be something like that. Notably that the Coop Bank was one of the only ones to avoid the financial crisis, specifically because they voted against the practices that led to it for being predatory. They needed no bailout, and it's one of the reasons I personally hate the bailouts.\\n\\nThat's an example of how co-ops can differ wildly depending on the local company culture. Mondragon is practically the opposite. It has some of the best conditions for their employees in the country, and might be the best if you have no school qualifications. They regularly vote to improve their conditions. On the other hand, they are pretty ruthless about paying and treating third world workers further up the supply chain like crap.\\n\\nIt's always worth researching an employer, but with co-ops that's especially relevant.</td>\n",

       "6   A normal company is owned by shareholders. If a company has 10 shares, those shares are divided between people, and they can sell their share to other people. The shareholders elect a CEO and approve major decisions at stockholder meetings, often held once a year. The CEO runs the basics of the company, makes major appointments and so on, determines wages, etc. The excess profits the company makes which are not put into maintainence or expansion, are then divided by the shareholders. So if after everyone is paid, the bills are paid, and after the new factory has been built and paid for, the company has an extra 10 million dollars lying around, each share receives 1 million dollars. (In reality, it's more likely a company has thousands of shares.). Usually things like building the new factory have to be approved by shareholders, as it's \"Their\" excess money you are tapping into.\\n\\nOne person could own 6 of the 10 shares. This is called being a \"Majority shareholder\", it means they make all the decisions and the only reason for others to own shares is to get a slice of the profits after each year.\\n\\nIn a worker cooperative there are no shareholders of  this kind. Instead, working at the company (Sometimes, working there for a length of time like 3 years) gets you one share, and you cannot sell it. You can then elect the CEO, who will set wages, make major appointments, and so on. You can also receive your share of the companies profits at the end of each year. (Most cooperatives will differentiate here however, and say that while everyone gets one vote, some jobs earn more share of the profit than others. Mondragon uses 3 shares for unskilled labour, 5 for skilled labour, 7 for experts and managers.).\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe workers, like shareholders, can decide to call an emergency meeting to fire the CEO if they get up to shenanigans. They can propose things at the annual meetings like \"Wages must be set to X\" and vote on them.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nImagine everything at the company was the same, but the workers and shareholders are the same people. Since they aren't doing the same job at the same time, nothing would actually change about your job and how you do it, beyond the fact that the people who own your company would be you and your co-workers. 9-5 your job remains the same and with the same stuff going on. It's just that once a year you go to the shareholder meeting and make decisions.\\n\\nSo basically, a workers cooperative are where Workers are like Batman. But instead of secretly being Batman, occasionally they become Bruce Wayne for a day. You wouldn't know it unless you happened to observe them changing out of their overalls into suits and ties to go to the stockholder meeting, though you might suspect something is amiss by the way their bosses seem not to be assholes to them, their work seems comfortable and well paid, and their CEO pops in to say hi and ask if they need anything.\\n\\nThis has a wide range of effects which are bit more complicated.   \n",

I could build a nearly identical house using either tool, and it would be effectively the same.

Why judge something based on the tool used when it is the house that was built that matters?\\n\\nThis is true for GMOs too.

But day to day, it's pretty much the same, except suddenly your bosses and their bosses are chosen by your peers instead of people only interested in how much money the company makes. A co-op could decide to act the same way and be like; \"We're a co-op for people who don't care about the job being miserable, because it's all about the money money money\", and that's fine. Most wouldn't though.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAppointing a CEO who promises to freeze wages, downsize, and deliver more profit to shareholders is pretty common.

       "6   The Coop supermarket in the UK is better than average... but not as good as you'd expect, because most of their effort is spent on voting to do things like fair trade, avoid investing in landmines and so on. That's one explanation. If you framed it purely on a local scale, the co-op is just a better than normal employer, but nothing revolutionary. But that'd be ignoring that all their goods pay third world farmers well, they don't use sweat shops, they don't invest in unethical businesses, are aiming for total renewability, and so on. That's where a lot of their focus is on their meetings and where a lot of the money goes. It could be something like that. Notably that the Coop Bank was one of the only ones to avoid the financial crisis, specifically because they voted against the practices that led to it for being predatory. They needed no bailout, and it's one of the reasons I personally hate the bailouts.\\n\\nThat's an example of how co-ops can differ wildly depending on the local company culture. Mondragon is practically the opposite. It has some of the best conditions for their employees in the country, and might be the best if you have no school qualifications. They regularly vote to improve their conditions. On the other hand, they are pretty ruthless about paying and treating third world workers further up the supply chain like crap.\\n\\nIt's always worth researching an employer, but with co-ops that's especially relevant.
